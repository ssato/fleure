fleure, a successor of rk-updateinfo (rpmkit.updateinfo cli), is a package
level static analysis tool for systems running RPM-based linux distributions
such like RHEL (primary target) and Fedora.

fleure loads RPM database files, tries to fetch updateinfo data from yum repos
and do some analysis based on these data.
