fleure (フルーア) [#]_ , a successor of rk-updateinfo (rpmkit.updateinfo cli),
is a package level static analysis tool for systems running RPM-based linux
distributions such like RHEL (primary target) and Fedora.

fleure loads RPM database files of target hosts, tries to fetch updateinfo data
from yum repos and do some analysis based on these data.
